"""Answer to question 6."""

"""
I would first write a unit test to see if two lines that don't intersect will return None.
The second test would be to test if the correct coordinates are return when two lines intersect at one point.
The third test would be to test if the function returns the first argument when two lines lay on top of each other.
For the forth test, I would test if the function will throw an error if the arguments are not lines.
For the fifth test, I would test if a line with floats as points and doesn't intersect will return None.
For the sixth test, I would test if a line with floats as points that intersect will return the point where they
intersect.
